# advancedCompArch

This class focused on writing GPU code (CUDA, specifically) and comparing the runtime between a sequential cpu implementation and a parallelized gpu implementation.

* cuda-deblur: A novel deblurring algorithm.
* gpu-sfft: An attempt to replicate the GPU-SFFT algorithm proposed by Oswaldo Artiles and Fahad Saeed.
