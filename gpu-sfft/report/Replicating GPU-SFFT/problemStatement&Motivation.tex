\section{Problem Statement and Motivation}
In this project we attempt to implement the GPU-SFFT algorithm described in \cite{GPU-SFFT}. 
We aim to achieve both the speedup improvements specified in the paper, 23x faster than MIT-SFFT and 5x faster than cuFFT,
as well as maintain a similar output accuracy as the MIT-SSFT.
